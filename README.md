<h1>Constructing quotient groups using cosets representatives</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this project we explore a particular way of constructing quotient groups using the cosets representatives construction. We show how we may use computers to represent binary operations. In particular, we write functions that check whether the properties of a group hold: associativity, identity,inverses. Then, we present a way of defining equivalence relations using computers. We show how we can obtain the equivalence classes and then a minimal set of representatives. Finally, we write a function that constructs quotient groups using the coset representatives construction.
